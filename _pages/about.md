Hi! I am Satwik, currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), specializing in quantum computing, machine learning systems, and security. I am advised by [Prof. Swaroop Ghosh](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=szg212). 

My research focuses on making quantum computing more **efficient** and **secure** for real-world deployment. On the efficiency front, I work on optimization techniques to accelerate variational quantum algorithms while reducing quantum resource requirements. On the security front, I address vulnerabilities across the quantum software stack, from adversarial attacks on quantum neural networks (including model stealing and data poisoning) to confidentiality risks in quantum compilers.

My interests also span **efficient ML systems** and **hardware-software co-design for AI**, where I aim to apply my background in compiler optimization, parallel computing, and adversarial ML to bridge quantum and classical AI systems.

Before joining Penn State, I received my bachelor's degree from Jadavpur University, where I worked on projects ranging from facial expression recognition to microarchitectural security in Docker containers.

Hi! I am Satwik, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), specializing in quantum computing, machine learning and security. 
I am advised by [Prof. Swaroop Ghosh](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=szg212). 
My research focuses on developing frameworks to enhance the security of quantum neural networks (QNNs) 
against adversarial threats, improving the efficiency of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), 
and exploring applications of VQAs.

Before joining Penn State, I received my bachelor's degree from Jadavpur University in 2021. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects, 
from creating facial expression recognition models to addressing microarchitectural security challenges in Docker containers.

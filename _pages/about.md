Hi! I am Satwik, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), 
specializing in the evolving fields of quantum computing and machine learning. 
I am advised by [Dr. Swaroop Ghosh](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=szg212). 
My research focuses on developing frameworks to enhance the security of quantum neural networks (QNNs) 
against adversarial threats, improving the efficiency of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), 
and exploring the intersection of quantum computing and hardware security.

Before joining Penn State, I received my bachelor's degree from Jadavpur University in 2021. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects, 
from creating facial expression recognition models to addressing microarchitectural security challenges in Docker containers.

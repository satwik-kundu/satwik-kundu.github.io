Hi! I am Satwik, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State, 
specializing in the evolving fields of quantum computing and machine learning. 
I am advised by Prof. [Swaroop Ghosh](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=szg212). 
My research focuses on developing frameworks to enhance the security of quantum neural networks (QNNs) 
against adversarial threats, improving the efficiency of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), 
and exploring the intersection of quantum computing and hardware security.

Before joining Penn State, I received my bachelor's degree from Jadavpur University in 2021. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have contributed to diverse projects, 
from creating facial expression recognition models to addressing microarchitectural security challenges in Docker containers.

<!-- I also spent a summer  remotely working as a research intern at IIT Kharagpur, where I was advised by Prof. [John Pauly](https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/). 
I am Satwik Kundu, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, where I focus on advancing the efficiency and security of quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms. 
My research, guided by Prof. Swaroop Ghosh, spans developing frameworks to enhance the security of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) against adversarial threats, optimizing variational quantum algorithms, and exploring the intersection of quantum computing and hardware security.

Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve contributed to diverse projects, from creating facial expression recognition models to tackling microarchitectural security challenges in client-server frameworks.-->
